            Hi! My name is Toya Okey-Nwamara, and I am currently a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am passionate about technology, cybersecurity, philosophy, politics, and solving challenging problems. This portfolio is a showcase of my journey, my projects, and the skills I have developed.

            Outside of academia, I enjoy reading, gaming and having a fun conversation; I am always excited to explore new opportunities to grow and contribute to impactful projects.
